        I didn\'t want to be the one to forget\n
I thought of everything I\'d never regret\n
Let\'s run with it because it\'s all we can take\n
One thing I\'d never see, the same way around\n
I don\'t believe it and it slips from the ground\n
I want to take you to that place near the rush\n
But no one gives us any time anymore\n
You used me once [?]\n
You made an offer for it, then you ran off\n
I got this picture of us kissin\' in my head\n
And all I hear is the last thing that you said\n
Listen to you brother, and listen to me\n
I didn\'t want to anymore\n

And we will never be alone again\n
\'Cause it doesn\'t happen everyday\n
Kinda counted on you being a friend\n
Kinda given up on giving away\n
Now I thought about what I wanna say\n
But I never really know where to go\n
So I chained myself to a friend\n
\'Cause there\'s nowhere else I could go\n

And we will never be alone again\n
\'Cause it doesn\'t happen everyday\n
Kinda counted on you being a friend\n
Kinda given up on giving away\n
Now I thought about what I wanna say\n
But I never really know where to go\n
So I chained myself to a friend\n

Some more again\n

It didn\'t matter what they wanted to see\n
You thought he saw someone that looked just like me\n
I saw my memory that just never dies\n
We worked too long and hard to give it no time\n
He sees right through me, it\'s so easy with lies\n
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise\n
He runs the scissors at the seam in the wall\n
He cannot break it down or else he would fall\n
One thousand lonely stars\n
Hiding in the cold\n
Take it, oh I don\'t wanna sing anymore\n

Listen to you brother, and listen to me\n
I didn\'t want to anymore\n

And we will never be alone again\n
\'Cause it doesn\'t happen everyday\n
Kinda counted on you being a friend\n
Kinda given up on giving away\n
Now I thought about what I wanna say\n
But I never really know where to go\n
So I chained myself to a friend\n
\'Cause there\'s nowhere else I could go\n

And we will never be alone again\n
\'Cause it doesn\'t happen everyday\n
Kinda counted on you being a friend\n
Kinda given up on giving away\n
Now I thought about what I wanna say\n
But I never really know where to go\n
So I chained myself to a friend\n
\'Cause there\'s nowhere else I could go\n

I don\'t wanna start, don\'t get upset\n
I\'m not with you\n
It\'s all I do when I\'m with you\n

And we will never be alone again\n
\'Cause it doesn\'t happen everyday\n
Kinda counted on you being a friend\n
Kinda given up on giving away\n
Now I thought about what I wanna say\n
But I never really know where to go\n
